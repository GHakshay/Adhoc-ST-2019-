# DAY 15
# MACHINE LEARNING
-----
## Notes
  * Data is all about business these days
  * combination of science and data to generate and valuabe data to be used in Business is DATA SCIENCE
  * Python cannot process more then 10GB data at once
  * Machine learning is logical analysis of data to accurately do your work
  * AI is a kind of project management (e.g, autodriving of car)
  * Matlab is a mixture of numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib
  * Collection of homogenous values is array
  * slashlinuxcode.blogspot.com use to study about numpy

## Data Science
 * In this domain we have:
  1. Bigdata -> domain to store and process , very large amount of data
  2. Machine Learning - > an sorted data is taken from bigdata to be used

## Machine Learning
  * A branch in which we teach something to ML and it keeps on learning using logical approach and datasets available to it
  * it will be a communication between user and machine in the language of maths
  * Libraries to be used mostly to deal with data and visualize it :
    1. Numpy
    2. Pandas
    3. SeaBorn
    4. Matplotlib

  * basic data structures used :
    1. list
    2. tuple
    3. for
    4. set

## NUMPY
  * Numerical Python or numpy
  * library to use numeric data
  * its advanced version is Tensor Flow
  * stores and process data in the form of array

## Data Processing and Visualization
  * its better to represent the data in graphical form rather then numerical values
  * Libraries popularly used for Visualization are:
    1. MPLD3
    2. matplotlib
    3. Seaborn
    4. gnuplot
    5. Dash

## MATPLOTLIB
  * its an open source project and we can be contribute in it
  * to delete a module which is imported use
  ```python
  del module-name
  ```
