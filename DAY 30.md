# DAY 31

## Notes
  * DLRM is a open source Deep Learning Recommendation Model introduced by Facebook for tensorflow and deeplearning.
  * NLP has
    1. NLTK
    2. SPACY
    3. TEXT BLOB
    4. Stemming
    5. Lemmatization
    6. Sentimental Analysis
  * fbcli -> a facebook command line interface for linux
  ```
  pip3 install fbcli
  ```
  * the rate of transfer from a pendrive to HDD is depended upon the IO rate of pendrive which is based on the material used for making the HDD
  * GPU is required when higher graphical work is necessary
  * Python is an interpreted language
  * Namespace is the private space of different compilers over a same system RAM which is not accessible by other compilers
  * Provision Space - > the minimum amount of space that is required by some service

## Sentiment Analysis Project
  * Make a combination of text,image/video,voice and then search for sentiment analysis

## Tensorflow
  * In deep learning the most important component is GPU and gym , a library of openai uses a lot of GPU for processing
  * it is a concept developed in deeplearning which interprets or calculates the requirements
  * Tensor is a dimension - with some value ( Tensor can 1D / 2D or 3D )
  * Tensorflow is a mixture of tensor and graph
  * this library is made for heavier and high level mathematical calculations
  * It can be though as SuperAdvanced Version of numpy
  * To install tensorflow
  ```
  pip3 install tensorflow
  ```
  * to interact with gpu in system -- heavy software 377M and only for system with gpu
  ```
  pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
  ```
  * Tensorflow has 3 categories for taking data as input
    1. Constant -> defined by developer
    2. Variables -> defined by user
    3. Placeholder  -> takes input from user at run time just like input function

  * Compilation - > checking the syntax of some file and creating a file stored in RAM to be initialsed anytime
  * Tensorflow is not python , its just supported by it
  * Its background is made in complete C++

  ### Popular Project in tensorflow
    * CNN
    * poet -> for image classification 
    * posenet  - > object detection(simplest in tensorflow )
    * yolo
