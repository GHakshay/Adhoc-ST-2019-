## CNN
  * Convolution - > refers to finding or extracting features
  * CNN - > in real is CANN - > Convolution Artificial Neural Network
  * Convolution is divided into three parts
    1. Convolution - > extract feature from image,video or anything
    2. Max pulling -> extracting maximum number value cam in feature map by matching the minimum matrix of 2x2
    3. Flattening - > converting the max pulling into a vector and is finally used for ANN
  * Feature map - > an sample image that we wish to find in a particular image is matched and checked over the 2nd image and the resultant output is stored in another table called feature map
  * The size of sample image depends upon the CPU and GPU of system
  * Overfitting - > problem that arises by training the model again and again and causes a diminishing in accuracy, due to possible occurence of impurity in data ( chaning minimum data )
  * Workon and Study everything on ```imageai.org```
  * ANN prefers cluster computing
